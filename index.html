            <h3>The city of water falls</h3>
            <p>
              Sioux Falls is named for the Sioux tribe of American Indians and
              the waterfalls of the Big Sioux River, located a few blocks from
              today’s downtown district. The Sioux tribe named the water Minne
              Waukon (sacred water). The falls remain a popular local landmark
              and tourist attraction. Many of the venerable reminders of Sioux
              Falls´ pioneer past were constructed out of the region’s
              distinctive rose quartzite and serve as testimony to the founders´
              hard work, vision and commitment to community. Many of the city’s
              older buildings made of this rose quartzite are still standing
              today.
